Project Overview: PDF Extraction System


This project is designed to extract structured content from PDF files, including text, metadata, fonts, and images, with robust error handling,optional image support, and interactive CLI tools. It uses PyMuPDF for rendering PDFs,Pillow for image processing, and NumPy for efficient computation.



FILE 1: pdf_extraction_pipeline.py
‚úÖ Purpose:
This is the core engine of the entire system. It defines the class EfficientPDFExtractor, which performs the actual PDF processing and content extraction.

What It Contains:
EfficientPDFExtractor class:

Handles file validation, caching, and hashing to avoid redundant processing.

Uses PyMuPDF (fitz) to read PDFs page-by-page, which is both memory-efficient and fast.

Extracts:

Plain text (page.get_text())

Font metadata

Number of characters and words

Embedded images (optional)

Document metadata (author, title, etc.)

extract_pdf_content() method:

The heart of the pipeline. Iterates through all pages, collects structured content into a list of dictionaries (pages), and wraps everything into a PDFExtractionResult dataclass.

process_pdf() alias:

Ensures compatibility with test runners like bulletproof_test.py.

save_result():

Saves the extracted results in .json or .txt format, including a summary for quick viewing.

demonstrate_usage():

A standalone test runner that shows how the system performs single or batch extraction. Helpful for local CLI testing.

‚úÖ Why This Matters:
It‚Äôs the processing backend. Everything else (tests, demos, CLI tools) plugs into this class to do the real extraction work.



FILE 2: bulletproof_test.py
‚úÖ Purpose:
This is a robust test harness designed to check whether your Python environment is properly configured and if the PDF extraction pipeline works end-to-end.

What It Contains:
Environment check:

Verifies Python version and path

Confirms PyMuPDF, Pillow, NumPy are installed

PDF check:

Looks inside the /test_pdfs/ directory to ensure at least one PDF is available for testing.

Basic Extraction Test:

Tries opening the PDF with fitz and extracts first-page text, image count, and metadata.

Full Extraction Pipeline Test:

Imports EfficientPDFExtractor from pdf_extraction_pipeline.py

Runs the full extraction process and saves the result as .json

‚úÖ Why This Matters:
This script is your first diagnostic tool. If this works, your system is fully functional. It's excellent for checking setup before deploying or developing further.



üìü FILE 3: interactive_demo.py
‚úÖ Purpose:
Provides a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) to:

List PDF files

Extract content from a selected PDF

Batch process all PDFs

Open output folders directly

What It Contains:
Menu-driven interface with options from 0‚Äì5

Uses os.startfile() or os.system('open') to open output folders

Internally calls EfficientPDFExtractor to process files

Handles exceptions and guides the user interactively

‚úÖ Why This Matters:
This tool is great for non-programmers or testers who want to run the extraction process without writing any code. It's also helpful for demoing the pipeline in front of stakeholders.

Library	Why It's Used
PyMuPDF	Main engine to read, render, and extract PDF data
Pillow	Handles image manipulation and saving
NumPy	Used for handling image arrays, speed optimization
json	For saving structured output in .json files
hashlib	Used to generate MD5 hash of files to avoid duplicate processing
logging	Displays progress info, warnings, and errors cleanly
datetime	Adds timestamp to outputs



Follow these steps after **downloading** or **cloning** the repo from GitHub:

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Open Terminal in `src/` folder

In VS Code or your system terminal:

cd pdf_extraction_master/src
### ‚úÖ Step 2: Create Virtual Environment

python -m venv pdf_env

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Activate the Environment
Windows:

.\pdf_env\Scripts\activate

macOS/Linux:

source pdf_env/bin/activate

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Install Required Packages

pip install PyMuPDF
pip install Pillow
pip install numpy
pip install requests

### ‚úÖ Step 5:

Test Core Installation:

python -c "import fitz; print('PyMuPDF works!')"
python -c "import PIL; print('Pillow works!')"
python -c "import numpy; print('Numpy works!')"

Advanced Packages 

pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install transformers
pip install opencv-python
pip install pdf-extract-kit
pip install docling

### These are the core libraries:

PyMuPDF for PDF parsing
